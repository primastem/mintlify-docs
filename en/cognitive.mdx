# For Elderly People

Restoration of Cognitive Functions in Older Adults Using the PrimaStem Robotic System

## INTRODUCTION

PrimaStem is a robotic system consisting of a programmable robot and a control panel with a set of command chips. The system can be used for the prevention and correction of cognitive impairments in older adults.

### Target Audience

- Elderly people with mild cognitive impairments
- Individuals recovering from neurological diseases
- Patients at early stages of neurodegenerative diseases

### Contraindications

- Severe visual impairment
- Significant motor impairments of the upper limbs
- Severe dementia
- Acute psychiatric disorders

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES

With age and in neurodegenerative diseases, there can be memory decline, reduced ability for abstract thinking, learning, and creativity. Activities with the PrimaStem set help slow these processes by training various cognitive skills in an engaging game-based format.

### Methodological Recommendations

### Organization of Sessions

- Duration of one session: 30–45 minutes
- Frequency: 2–3 times per week
- Format: individual or small groups (2–4 people)
- Required breaks: 5–10 minutes after every 15–20 minutes of work

### Guiding Principles for Sessions

1. Gradual increase in task complexity
2. Consideration of individual characteristics and limitations
3. Creating a positive emotional environment
4. Alternating different types of exercises
5. Mandatory feedback and encouragement

## MAIN AREAS OF INTERVENTION

### Cognitive Functions

- Intellectual stimulation
- Development of spatial thinking and memory
- Improvement of visual and auditory-verbal memory
- Training logical thinking and mental arithmetic
- Development of planning and activity control skills
- Training peripheral vision

### Socio-Emotional Aspects

- Maintaining personal potential and social activity
- Creating opportunities for self-expression
- Overcoming communication barriers
- Forming a positive emotional background

## TRAINING OPTIONS AND GAME-BASED EXERCISES

### 1. Basic Exercises (Adaptation Period)

- Getting to know the command chips
- Simple straight robot movements
- Performing basic turns
- Creating simple command sequences

### 2. Training Spatial Thinking

#### Route Building

- Shortest path
- Taking obstacles into account
- Using a random set of command chips
- Following a given algorithm
- Choosing the correct route from suggested options
- Constructing a return route

#### Levels of Difficulty

1. Determining the endpoint based on a given route
2. Choosing the correct route from a list
3. Identifying the starting point given the endpoint

#### Working With Real Spaces

- Modeling familiar rooms (living rooms, corridors)
- Planning routes indoors
- Passing through mazes

### 3. Training Planning Skills

- Building algorithms for daily actions:
    - "At the store – following a shopping list"
    - "Getting ready to go outside – what are my steps?"
- Using cards with images of items and actions

### 4. Training Spatial Memory

- Memorizing and reproducing routes (visually, aurally)
- Using mnemonic techniques (Method of Loci)
- Playing "MEMO"-type games:
    - Finding and memorizing pairs of cards

### 5. Mathematical Games

- Mathematical mazes – moving across cells with math problems
- Arithmetic route – repeated addition/subtraction of the same number

### 6. Word Games

- Searching for proverbs on the field
- Composing words from scattered letters
- Creating routes on images with specific sounds

### 7. Pencil Games (Drawing)

#### Graphic Dictations

- Building an algorithm based on a drawing
- Completing the symmetrical half
- Correcting errors in an algorithm
- Drawing a mirror image
- Rotating a figure by 90 degrees
- Creating patterns and ornaments using loops

### 8. Communication Games

#### Competitive Exercises

- Collecting the maximum number of bonus chips
- Playing "Monopoly" with the robot
- Word game for searching letters
- "Maze" board game for two players

## ASSESSING EFFECTIVENESS

### Control Methods

- Regular cognitive function testing
- Observing the dynamics of task completion
- Gathering feedback from participants
- Keeping a logbook of sessions

### Success Criteria

- Improved task performance indicators
- Increased complexity of exercises performed
- Positive subjective assessment from participants
- Transfer of skills to daily life

## PROGRAM ADAPTATION RECOMMENDATIONS

### Individualization

- Consider physical limitations
- Adapt the pace of sessions
- Modify tasks based on participant interests
- Develop an individual progression plan

### Group Work

- Grouping participants by ability level
- Including competitive elements
- Supporting mutual assistance
- Creating a comfortable social environment
