# Teacher’s Guide

This guide describes the features of the PrimaSTEM set required for creating lessons and integrating it into the educational process.

PrimaSTEM is an educational toy for children aged 4–12 that helps them learn to program a friendly robot without computers, tablets, or phones. It develops logic, programming skills, and mathematics.

Lessons with PrimaSTEM make programming simple and visual for children. Even very young learners find the process clear and tactile-the basics of programming, logic, and mathematics are learned in a playful form.

Playing with PrimaSTEM fosters the development of key skills: logical thinking, algorithms, programming, mathematics, geometry, as well as creative and social-emotional development.
The PrimaSTEM set is a preparatory stage to getting acquainted with block-based programming languages such as [Scratch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scratch_(programming_language)) or [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)).

## Getting Acquainted With the Educational Set

### Where Can PrimaSTEM Be Used?

Effective applications in the following educational programs:

- Early childhood education centers
- Montessori kindergartens
- Primary schools
- Homeschooling
- Special development centers
- After-school groups
- Introductory programming clubs
- Children’s educational camps

### What Should You Know to Start?

Before using the set, we recommend teachers and parents read the [user manual](user_manual.md) and this guide. No special programming skills are required-the materials provide the foundation needed for teaching.

## Research and Value of the Set

PrimaSTEM is inspired by the [LOGO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) programming language, created by [Seymour Papert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seymour_Papert), and Montessori pedagogy. LOGO and the turtle robot made programming visual and accessible for children.

PrimaSTEM command chips implement this approach. Learning becomes intuitive through simple tactile control, requiring no screens or text.

By observing the robot, children learn the meaning of each command by practicing algorithms in real time.

The robot has an important feature: it has direction, which allows a child to identify with it and more easily understand the fundamental logic of how programs work.

All commands are simple and clear: they indicate exactly which direction the robot should move. Teaching the robot to “act” or “think” encourages children to reflect on their own actions and thoughts, making the process of learning programming more effective.

PrimaSTEM chips are a visual and simplified representation of programming languages. At the start of learning there is no text or numbers-only basic commands.

### Why Wood?

🌱 The controller and robot are made of wood. Practice has shown that children prefer playing with wooden toys-they are safe, durable, and create a sense of personal history in use.

## Programming Concepts With PrimaSTEM

PrimaSTEM’s physical chips are analogous to instructions in real programming languages, demonstrating important concepts.

### Algorithms

**Algorithms** are sequences of precise commands (chips) that make up a program.

### Queue

Commands on the PrimaSTEM controller are executed strictly from left to right, visually demonstrating execution order.

### Debugging (Error Correction)

Mistakes are easy to correct: simply replace a chip. This approach develops independent debugging skills.

### Function

A function (subprogram) is a set of commands in the lower part of the controller, called from the main program using the “**Function**” chip.

## Application in Other Subjects

PrimaSTEM also helps develop other skills:

- **Communication**: Group play fosters collaboration.
- **Motor skills**: Working with chips improves coordination.
- **Social skills**: Children gain confidence and learn teamwork.
- **Mathematics**: Basic mathematical concepts are mastered.
- **Logic**: Children learn to construct sequences and predict outcomes.

> By arranging chips, the child explores programming in a tactile, visual, and intellectual way. After pressing the “Execute” button, the robot moves, and the result is compared to the child’s expectation. This comprehensive experience accelerates learning.

## Getting to Know the Robot and Controller

### Robot

Tell the children that the robot is their friend, which they can program. Explain: it has no thoughts of its own and only performs their instructions-like household appliances that require turning on.

![robot](images/robot.excalidraw.svg)

### Controller

Explain that the controller sends commands to the robot. Show how to insert command chips and program the robot.

![control](images/control.excalidraw.svg)

> The main program is constructed in the upper row of the controller (6 slots). The lower row (5 slots) is for the subprogram/function and used with the “**Function**” command.

### Command Chips

Chips are commands for the robot that are inserted into the controller. After pressing “Execute,” the robot performs the sequence. Each chip is a separate command, which teaches computational thinking and program design. It is important for children to understand what the robot does when each command is activated-this teaches them to plan programs and predict the robot’s actions. Tell children: chips should not be lost or damaged-without them, the robot cannot move.

## 1 – The First Program

### Cause and Effect

The main goal is to show children the connection between a command and an action. Let the child insert a “Forward” chip in the first controller slot and press “Execute.” The child should observe the correspondence between chip and action.

![forvard](images/guide1a.excalidraw.svg)

### Clear Instructions

Repeat with each direction (**forward**, turn **left**, turn **right**) until the child recognizes each chip.

### The First Task

Lay out the playing field or create a 10×10 cm grid using tape or marker. Place the robot on the starting square. Ask the child to compose a program to move forward by one cell. If the wrong chip is used, return the robot and invite the child to reflect and try again.

## 2 – Program and Debugging

### Sequence of Events

Set the goal two cells in front of the robot.

![task-forvard*2](images/guide2d.excalidraw.svg)

Have the child compose a program of two chips to reach the goal.

![forvard*2](images/guide2a.excalidraw.svg)

### Sequence of Three Chips

This time, the goal is one cell in front and one to the right.

![task-forvard-right-forvard](images/guide2e.excalidraw.svg)

Invite the child to select the correct sequence of commands.

![forvard-right-forvard](images/guide2b.excalidraw.svg)

Don’t worry if the child chooses the wrong chip. Just return the robot to its starting position and suggest reasoning about the choice and trying again.

### Debugging-Finding the Error

Set a destination one square ahead and one square to the left of the robot.

![task-forvard-left-forvard](images/guide2f.excalidraw.svg)

This time, create a program by purposely inserting a wrong turn into the sequence.

![forvard-right-forvard](images/guide2b.excalidraw.svg)

Ask the child to predict which command in the program is incorrect, and to predict the wrong result, then allow them to press “**Execute**” to check the assumption.

After the child realizes the sequence was incorrect-either by reasoning or by checking-let them change the wrong command to the correct one, thereby debugging the program.

![forvard-left-forvard](images/guide2с.excalidraw.svg)

## 3 – Program With Function

### The “Function” Command

Once the basic commands are mastered, introduce the **Function** command chip. This is a repeatable set of commands that can be called from the main program.

> You can use the metaphor of a tower (other commands are stacked under the function chip) to explain that you can put more instructions inside a single chip.

Show an example: first, place two “Forward” chips in the top slots and run the program-the robot moves two cells.

![forvard*2](images/guide3a.excalidraw.svg)

Now, place the same two “Forward” chips in the function (bottom row), and in the main program, use “Function.” The result is the same, but now part of the program is hidden in the subprogram.

![function-forvard*2](images/guide3b.excalidraw.svg)

Next, create the sequence: **Forward – Forward – Right – Forward – Forward**.

![forvard*2-right-forvard*2](images/guide3c.excalidraw.svg)

Ask the children to find repeating sections and “hide” them in a function. The final sequence: in the main section-**Function – Right – Function**; at the bottom-**Forward – Forward**.

![function-right-function](images/guide3d.excalidraw.svg)

### Solving Tasks With Function

Give the child three “**Forward**” chips and two “**Function**” chips.

![chip-forwards-functions](images/guide3e.excalidraw.svg)

The task is to move forward five squares.

![goal-5step](images/guide3f.excalidraw.svg)

Let the child realize that a function must be used for repeated actions to solve this task.

If the sequence is wrong, just return the robot and suggest reasoning about a correct solution and trying again.

![function-task](images/guide3g.excalidraw.svg)

## 4 – Randomness

### The “Random Direction” Command

To introduce the idea of randomness, take three direction chips: “**Forward**,” “**Left**,” and “**Right**,” put them in an opaque box or bag, mix them, and ask the children to draw one without looking and show it to the group, then return it. Explain the concept of randomness among three outcomes with this example.

Next, show the “**Random Direction**” command chip-the picture on the chip repeats all three direction chips.

Explain that this chip does almost what they did previously by drawing chips from the bag: it randomly selects one of three commands for the robot and then moves it by one logical step-one cell. That is, the robot can move forward, right, or left by one cell.

Place the “**Random Command**” chip in the top slot and run the program several times-the robot will move differently each time.

![rnd-move](images/guide4a.excalidraw.svg)

Play with the children: let them guess where the robot will go before running the command.

Emphasize that this is **randomness** and it’s not always possible to guess the direction.

Try making a small game with the “**Random Command**” chip with the children.

## 5 – Loops (Command Repeats)

### Getting to Know Numeric Loops

Show the children value chips, ask if they know numbers, have ever seen dice for board games, or played such games.

![repeat-chips](images/guide5a.excalidraw.svg)

Put two “Forward” chips in the top row and run-the robot moves two cells.

![forvard*2](images/guide5b.excalidraw.svg)

Now, leave one “Forward,” and put a “repeat 2” chip under it. The result is the same: the action is repeated twice.

![forvard-repeat2](images/guide5c.excalidraw.svg)

Set up four “**Forward**” commands and see the result, then ask the children to use the value chips-**loops**-to repeat the robot’s move for four cells.

There are simple solutions by using the “**Forward**” chip and repeat 4, and others, such as “**Forward**” with loop 3 and an additional “**Forward**” command.

![repeat-task](images/guide5d.excalidraw.svg)

### Function Call in a Loop

Try using a loop value chip with the “Function” command: for example, have the robot walk in a zigzag by setting the “Function” command with loop value 5 and a sequence in the controller’s bottom section of “**Forward, Right, Forward, Left**.”

First, create a function program for “steps”: "forward," "right," "forward," "left," and run it.

Then add the loop with the value 5 to the function, so the function repeats several times-the robot will move as a staircase to the right and up.

![step-task](images/guide5e.excalidraw.svg)

The robot will move diagonally as a staircase, making 5 steps.

![step-task-result](images/guide5f.excalidraw.svg)

## 6 – Random Numbers

### The Concept of a Random Number

Among the chips is the “Random Number of Repeats” (shows a die). It selects a random value from 1 to 6. Play a game involving drawing repeat chips from a bag.

![rnd-repeat-chip](images/guide6a.excalidraw.svg)

To introduce the concept of a random number, take four repeat chips: “**2**,” “**3**,” “**4**,” and “**5**,” place them in an opaque box or bag, shuffle, and ask the children to draw one and name the value, then return it. Play a game to see who draws the largest number. Explain randomness of four states using this example.

Next, show the “**Random Number of Repeats**” value chip. Explain that this chip does similar to what they did before, drawing value chips from a bag: it randomly chooses one of six numbers (1 to 6), like a die, to send to the robot for command repeats.

Put the “**Forward**” chip in the top controller slot and the “**Random Number of Repeats**” chip below. Ask the children to press “**Execute**.” Return the robot to the original spot. Repeat this task several times.

![rnd-forvard](images/guide6b.excalidraw.svg)

Play a game: whose robot travels further?

Draw the children’s attention to the fact that the robot moves a random number of cells: from 1 to 6. Emphasize that this is randomness and you cannot know beforehand how far the robot will go.

## 7 – Numbers: Distances and Angles

### Getting to Know Numbers

Without setting numeric values for the commands (above or below the command in the double slot), the robot uses default movement parameters: without parameters, the robot drives forward 10 cm and turns 90°. These values can be changed by using number chips.... 

Example: add the value **200** to the **"Forward"** command and see how far the robot goes. Add value **180** to the **"turn"** command and observe the changes.

![example1](images/example1.excalidraw.svg)

> **Important:** The controller saves the last value set for movement and turn commands.
If a command is used without a new value, the last saved value is applied until the controller powers off.
Setting a new value changes the default parameter.
Default values (100 mm and 90°) can be restored by setting them explicitly or restarting the controller.

Changing parameters enables more complex trajectories and movement scenarios. See examples on the [mathematical drawings page](math_drawings.md).

## 8 – Arithmetic

### Arithmetic Operations

Arithmetic operations with numbers allow you to dynamically change values in a program for movement commands (Forward, Back, Left, Right), making robot control more flexible.

When you add an arithmetic operation, the controller changes the stored number for the movement command and sends a new value to the robot.

Example:

![example2](images/example2.excalidraw.svg)

“Forward 200”-the robot moves 20 cm, “Forward +100”-another 30 cm. Total distance: 50 cm.

Using such operations in a loop lets you create progressions.

> If, as a result of an arithmetic operation, the number becomes negative, the robot executes the inverse action: instead of forward, it moves back; instead of turning left, it turns right.

Available: addition (+), subtraction (−), multiplication (*), division (/), root (√), power (^).

Pattern examples are shown on the [mathematical drawings page](math_drawings.md).
