## INTRODUCTION[​](#introduction "Direct link to INTRODUCTION")

PrimaStem is a robotic system consisting of a programmable robot and a control panel with a set of command chips. The system can be used for the prevention and correction of cognitive impairments in older adults.

### Target Audience[​](#target-audience "Direct link to Target Audience")

* Elderly people with mild cognitive impairments
* Individuals recovering from neurological diseases
* Patients at early stages of neurodegenerative diseases

### Contraindications[​](#contraindications "Direct link to Contraindications")

* Severe visual impairment
* Significant motor impairments of the upper limbs
* Severe dementia
* Acute psychiatric disorders

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES[​](#general-principles "Direct link to GENERAL PRINCIPLES")

With age and in neurodegenerative diseases, there can be memory decline, reduced ability for abstract thinking, learning, and creativity. Activities with the PrimaStem set help slow these processes by training various cognitive skills in an engaging game-based format.

### Methodological Recommendations[​](#methodological-recommendations "Direct link to Methodological Recommendations")

### Organization of Sessions[​](#organization-of-sessions "Direct link to Organization of Sessions")

* Duration of one session: 30–45 minutes
* Frequency: 2–3 times per week
* Format: individual or small groups (2–4 people)
* Required breaks: 5–10 minutes after every 15–20 minutes of work

### Guiding Principles for Sessions[​](#guiding-principles-for-sessions "Direct link to Guiding Principles for Sessions")

1. Gradual increase in task complexity
2. Consideration of individual characteristics and limitations
